# Hydroponic-Wick-IoT-System
Hydroponics, a contemporary farming method, offers a solution for cultivating healthy plants and vegetables. Despite a growing interest in home gardening, many individuals face challenges due to limited space and uncertainties in plant care. To address these issues, an IoT Based Monitoring Hydroponic Wick System has been developed. This system employs sensors such as the DHT22, water level sensor, and soil moisture sensor, controlled by a NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller, to monitor crucial factors like temperature, humidity, water level, and soil moisture. Data collected from these sensors are stored in a MySQL database. Users can conveniently access a dashboard to view real-time and historical data on the status of their hydroponic setup. By providing accurate monitoring and control, this innovative system offers a practical solution for home gardeners, enabling them to overcome common challenges and ensure optimal conditions for plant growth.
